       <h2> Jack and the Beanstalk.</h2>
       <p id = "dragon" >The purpose of the "Jack and the beanstalk" game is to climb to the way top! We encountered many problems in the sprites movements up the beanstalk. There are many monsters along the way with many hazards too. The big mighty Dragon is the hardest to slay and the most dangerous. The players buggy movements took some changes to the script becaused it was doing three actions at the same time! (Walking,changing sprite, and when the up arrow is pressed change backgrounds). Changes allows for faster climbing speed and a much smoother experience while playing the game. </p>

  <p> My partner and I both sketched out our ideas on Draw.io. In order to make the story, concepts we needed to know in order to make the story are 'if-elif,choice = raw input, and print'. Indentation was a MAJOR problem for me it took many tries to reorganize it. I solved my problems by having placeholders for the options saying ' Option b or Option a.' This helped me organise my thoughs and keep my place. I really enjoyed it and would love to improve on it. My favorite part is when me and my partner drew out crazy ideas for our endings of the story. I dislike how it can be easily overwelming at first. It was kinda demoralizing for me when were working on the project. I really enjoyed the Lost at Sea interactive text. It had cool images to go with the story in the console. If I had the chance to redo this I would be overjoyed. I would invest even more time proof reading my gramatical errors.  </p>
